This paper develops deterministic and stochastic Frank–Wolfe recursions that operate directly on infinite-dimensional probability spaces via the influence function, avoiding discretization and enabling particle-based updates.  

We establish **O(1/k)** convergence for convex objectives and **O(1/√k)** for nonconvex cases, along with a fixed-step variant achieving exponential convergence and a central limit theorem.  

Applications include **emergency response optimization**, **experimental design**, and **Gaussian deconvolution**, demonstrating the practical utility of measure-space optimization methods.
