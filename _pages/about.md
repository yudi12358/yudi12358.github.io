Welcome! I’m Di Yu, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Raghu Pasupathy](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pasupath/).  
My research lies at the intersection of stochastic simulation, rare-event estimation, and optimization. I aim to develop theoretically grounded and practically efficient methods for analyzing rare events in high-dimensional systems.

My current work focuses on:  
- Rare-event simulation for stochastic systems  
- Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods  
- Stochastic root-finding and optimization  
- Applications in reliability analysis and performance evaluation  

Before joining Purdue, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Beihang University, Beijing, China. I enjoy exploring mathematical tools to solve real-world problems and contributing to open, reproducible science.

Please check my [CV](/files/CV.pdf) and [Publications](/publications/) for more details.
