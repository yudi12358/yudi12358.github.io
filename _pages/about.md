## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University. My research focuses on the development and analysis of simulation-based algorithms for **stochastic systems**, particularly in the context of **rare-event simulation**, **stochastic optimization**, and **Monte Carlo methods**.  
My long-term goal is to design methods that are both mathematically rigorous and computationally scalable, enabling the study of complex, high-dimensional systems that are otherwise intractable.

I am especially interested in understanding how simulation-based procedures can be adapted to improve efficiency in problems where **analytical characterizations are unavailable** and **data are limited or noisy**. My work is motivated by challenges in operations research, reliability engineering, and statistical computation.
